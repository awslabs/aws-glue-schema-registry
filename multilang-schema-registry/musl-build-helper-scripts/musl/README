# Build MUSL on glibc system

These scripts and docker files are utilized to build musl artifacts on a glibc system. 

These utilize the graalvm community musl docker image and a musl based image for CMAKE. The resulting files are put in the local file system

# Troubleshooting
Commonly because the docker containers set ownership permissions of the resulting libraries. Operations like mvn clean and cmake clean will fail due to lacking permissions on some files and directories. This can be resolved with a `sudo chown -R <username> .` in the root of this repository.


# usage
Ensure that `multilang-schema-registry/c/build` is deleted

Ensure that docker is installed

run `./build-musl.sh` 

The artifacts should be in each of the polygot language libs folders.
